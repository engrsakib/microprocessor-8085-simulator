 	 	 	 	;Program to echo a character.
 	 	 	 	;AFTER SERIAL DOWNLOAD IS COMPLETE, THIS PROGRA
	 	 	 	M WILL READBACK A CHARACTER
 	 	 	 	;ON THE CURRENT CONSOLE DEVICE (WHICH IS SERIAL
	 	 	 	 DEVICE IF PROGRAM IS DOWNLOADED
 	 	 	 	;USING SERIAL PORT), AND THEN WILL ECHO BACK TH
	 	 	 	E CHARACTER. IT WILL CONTINUE
 	 	 	 	;DOING THIS TILL AN 'A' IS RECEIVED.
 	 	 	 	
 	 	 	 	; FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE USING HYPERTERMINAL (T
	 	 	 	URN OFF THE ECHO CHARACTERS
 	 	 	 	; LOCALLY SETTING UNDER FILE->PROPERTIES->SETTI
	 	 	 	NGS->ASCII SETUP->ECHO TYPED CHARACTERS LOCALLY
	 	 	 	 (DO NOT TICK).
 	 	 	 	; NOW HYPERTERMINAL WILL NOT SHOW YOU WHAT YOU 
	 	 	 	ARE TYPING UNLESS THE RECEIVING DEVICE SENDS BA
	 	 	 	CK THE CHARACTERS
 	 	 	 	; (THE KIT MONITOR PRORGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SEND
	 	 	 	 BACK ALL CHARACTERS THAT IT RECEIVES).
 	 	 	 	; NOW AFTER RUNNING THE PROGRAM, YOU WILL SEE E
	 	 	 	VERY CHARACTER THAT YOU SEND DOWN THROUGH HYPER
	 	 	 	TERMINAL USING
 	 	 	 	; THE PC's KEYBOARD. THIS WILL CONTINUE TILL YO
	 	 	 	U PRESS 'A'.
 	 	 	 	; NOW TURN ON THE ECHO TYPED CHARACTERS LOCALLY
	 	 	 	 SETTING, AND RUN THE PROGRAM, YOU SHOULD SEE A
	 	 	 	LL THE
 	 	 	 	; CHARACTERS THAT YOU ARE TYPING ECHOED TWICE O
	 	 	 	N THE HYPERTERMINAL SCREEN.
