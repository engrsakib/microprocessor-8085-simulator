 	 	 	 	;****Following listing is w.r.t. battery backed
	 	 	 	 ram at 12DC:0100h but this 
 	 	 	 	;    programme can work in scratch pad ram loca
	 	 	 	ted at 00000h. You can 
 	 	 	 	;    Enter the same from 0110:0100 and execute.
 	 	 	 	
 	 	 	 	;A program to demonstrate the 8253 in Mode 3, w
	 	 	 	hich is also 
 	 	 	 	;called as Square-Wave Generator. The output wi
	 	 	 	ll remain high
 	 	 	 	;until one half the count has been completed. (
	 	 	 	for even numbers)
 	 	 	 	;and go low for the other half of the count. If
	 	 	 	 the count is odd 
 	 	 	 	;and the output is high, the first clock pulse 
	 	 	 	decrements the 
 	 	 	 	;count by 1 subsequent clock pulses decrement t
	 	 	 	he clock by 2. 
 	 	 	 	;After time out, the output goes low and the fu
	 	 	 	ll count is reloaded,
 	 	 	 	;the first clock pulse decrements the counter b
	 	 	 	y 3 subsequent
 	 	 	 	;clock pulses decrement the count by 2, until t
	 	 	 	imeout. In this
 	 	 	 	;way if the count is odd the output will be hig
	 	 	 	h for (n+1) / 2 
 	 	 	 	;counts and low for (n-1) / 2 counts.
